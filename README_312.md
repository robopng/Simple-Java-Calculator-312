Code of conduct:
Keep it professional. If you disagree with someone’s implementation of something, 
politely ask if there might be a better way to do it - if their way is efficient and scalable, 
leave it as is. What matters most, though, is that what’s written works.

Mission statement:
We want to provide an easily expandable, modernized refit of the Java calculator project. 
We do not want to stray from the core tenets lined out in the original project - 
simplicity and ease of use - and want to keep the project understandable to even a beginner 
with Java, given some willingness to ask questions about the codebase. Still, we want to 
update more than just the old code, and want to expand functionality of the calculator so 
beginners can be introduced to a greater variety of programming concepts, like libraries,  
advanced conditional blocks, and logic flow control.
